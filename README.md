This is the source code for my [JavaScript Calculator](http://edkerforne.github.io/javascript-calculator), a calculator app made in React.

It was made for the freeCodeCamp [front end libraries challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator). You can see the built code [here](http://edkerforne.github.io/javascript-calculator/tree/gh-pages).
